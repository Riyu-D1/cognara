# Cognara Authentication Setup

## 🚀 Quick Start - Email/Password Authentication Works Now!

**Good news**: Email/password authentication is fully working without any additional setup! You can:

1. **Sign up** with any email and password (min. 6 characters)
2. **Sign in** with your credentials 
3. **Access all Cognara features** immediately

## 📧 Email Authentication (Ready to Use)

✅ **Create Account**: Enter email, password, and optional name  
✅ **Sign In**: Use your email and password  
✅ **User Profiles**: Your information appears in settings  
✅ **Secure Sessions**: Automatic login persistence  
✅ **Password Reset**: Built-in Supabase password recovery  

## 🔐 OAuth Setup (Optional Enhancement)

OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Discord) require additional configuration in your Supabase dashboard but are **not required** for the app to work.

### If you want to add OAuth providers:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to Authentication → Providers
   - Enable the providers you want (Google, GitHub, Discord)

2. **Follow Supabase's Setup Guides**
   - [Google OAuth Setup](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google)
   - [GitHub OAuth Setup](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github)  
   - [Discord OAuth Setup](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-discord)

3. **Add OAuth App Credentials**
   - Create OAuth apps on each provider's platform
   - Copy Client IDs and Secrets to Supabase dashboard

## 🛠 What's Implemented

✅ **Complete Backend API** with Supabase integration  
✅ **Secure User Registration** with email confirmation  
✅ **Session Management** with automatic token refresh  
✅ **User Profiles** with real data display  
✅ **Error Handling** with helpful error messages  
✅ **Protected Routes** requiring authentication  

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If you get "provider is not enabled" errors:**
- This only affects OAuth buttons (Google, GitHub, Discord)
- Email/password authentication still works perfectly
- Use the email form to sign up/sign in instead

**For the best immediate experience:**
1. Click "Sign up" at the bottom of the login form
2. Enter any email address and password (6+ characters)
3. Optionally add your name
4. Click "Create Account"
5. You'll be automatically signed in and can use all features

## 💡 Next Steps

Once you're signed in with email/password, you can:
- Create and organize study notes
- Generate flashcards from your content  
- Take quizzes to test your knowledge
- Use distraction-free study mode
- Customize settings and preferences

The OAuth setup is purely optional - your Cognara experience is complete with email authentication!
