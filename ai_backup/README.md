# AI Features Restoration Guide

## Working Configuration Backup Created: October 2, 2025

This directory contains working copies of all AI-related components that were successfully tested and functional before the GitHub commit update.

## Files Backed Up:
1. `AITest_working.tsx` - Main AI chat interface (fully functional)
2. `AIConnectionTest_working.tsx` - Diagnostic component (working with lint errors that are safe to ignore)
3. `ai_service_working.ts` - Core AI service layer (working with lint errors that are safe to ignore)
4. `AIPage_working.tsx` - AI page wrapper (working)
5. `working_env` - Environment variables file with working API keys

## Critical Configuration:
- Google AI Model: `gemini-2.0-flash` (DO NOT use gemini-1.5-flash - it's deprecated)
- Google AI API Key: AIzaSyBMmRv9y-ZdqDRdcPoGErYsXdcBAg0ZEKg (tested working)
- YouTube Data API Key: AIzaSyBQPe014hsgMViSzah-93_p24d30_I7a64 (tested working)
- LocalStorage prefix: `studyflow-*` (not cognara-*)

## Restoration Process:
When you provide the new GitHub commit:

1. I will first update all code to match the new commit
2. Then copy these working AI components back into place
3. Ensure all imports and dependencies are correctly updated
4. Test that AI functionality is preserved
5. Fix any integration issues between new commit and AI features

## Features That Work:
- ✅ AI Chat conversations
- ✅ YouTube video analysis
- ✅ Chat history persistence
- ✅ Connection testing and diagnostics
- ✅ Error handling and retries
- ✅ Multiple model fallbacks

## Notes:
- These files contain working imports that may show lint errors when outside the proper project structure
- The lint errors are safe to ignore - they're just path resolution issues in the backup folder
- All API keys have been tested and confirmed working on October 2, 2025
- The core functionality is complete and tested

## Last Successful Test:
All AI features were working properly at localhost:3001 before the authentication backup creation.
