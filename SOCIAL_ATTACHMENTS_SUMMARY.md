- Creates `post_attachments` table
- Creates `post_files` table for file uploads
- Adds RLS policies
- Includes validation triggers
- Creates helper views and functions

### 2. TypeScript Services
**Updated:** `src/services/social.ts`
- Added `PostAttachment` interface
- Added `PostFile` interface  
- Added `AttachmentDetails` interface
- Added `postAttachmentsService` with 6 functions
- Added `fileUploadService` with 2 functions

### 3. Documentation
**File:** `SOCIAL_ATTACHMENTS_GUIDE.md`
- Complete usage guide
- Code examples
- UI component templates
- Security features explained

## 🎯 Key Features

### What Users Can Do

✅ **Attach Notes** - Share study notes with posts
✅ **Attach Flashcards** - Share flashcard decks
✅ **Attach Quizzes** - Share practice quizzes
✅ **Upload Files** - Attach PDFs, images, documents
✅ **Multiple Attachments** - Add multiple items to one post
✅ **Preview Attachments** - See material details
✅ **Remove Attachments** - Delete attachments from posts

### LinkedIn-Inspired Design

- Document/resource sharing like LinkedIn posts
- Professional presentation of study materials
- Portfolio-building capability
- Resource discovery through social feed
- Collaborative learning features

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Run Migrations (5 minutes)

**First**, ensure you've run:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
1. social_migration.sql (if not already done)
2. social_attachments_migration.sql (NEW)
```

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket (optional, 2 minutes)

Only needed if you want file upload support:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create bucket: `post-files`
3. Set to public or configure RLS

### Step 3: Use the Service

The TypeScript service is ready! Import and use:

```typescript
import { postAttachmentsService } from './services/social';
```

## 💻 Quick Usage Examples

### Attach a Note to Post

```typescript
await postAttachmentsService.attachStudyMaterial(
  postId,
  'note',
  noteId,
  'My Calculus Notes',
  'Preview text...',
  { subject: 'Mathematics' }
);
```

### Get User's Materials for Selection

```typescript
const { notes, flashcards, quizzes } = 
  await postAttachmentsService.getUserStudyMaterials();
```

### Display Post Attachments

```typescript
const attachments = 
  await postAttachmentsService.getPostAttachments(postId);

for (const att of attachments) {
  const details = 
    await postAttachmentsService.getAttachmentDetails(att.id);
  // Display with details
}
```

### Upload and Attach File

```typescript
const file = await fileUploadService.uploadFile(fileObject);

await postAttachmentsService.attachFile(
  postId,
  file.id,
  file.file_name
);
```

## 🎨 What to Build Next (UI)

### Recommended Components

1. **Attachment Selector Modal**
   - Tabs for notes/flashcards/quizzes/files
   - List of user's materials
   - Search/filter capability
   - "Attach" button for each item

2. **Attachment Display Cards**
   - Icon based on type (📝 📇 ❓ 📎)
   - Title and preview
   - Metadata (word count, card count, etc.)
   - Click to view full material

3. **Enhanced Post Creator**
   - "Attach Study Material" button
   - Preview of selected attachments
   - Remove attachment option
   - Post type auto-switches to 'resource_share'

## 🔒 Security Built-In

✅ Only post author can add attachments
✅ Only own materials can be attached
✅ Attachments follow post visibility rules
✅ Automatic validation triggers
✅ RLS policies protect all data

## 📊 Database Structure

```
social_posts (existing)
     ↓ (one-to-many)
post_attachments (NEW)
     ↓ (references)
user_notes | user_flashcards | user_quizzes | post_files
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Students Can:
- Share helpful study guides with classmates
- Build a portfolio of study materials
- Get feedback on their notes
- Discover quality resources from peers
- Showcase achievements (completed materials)

### Platform Gets:
- Increased engagement
- User-generated quality content
- Community resource library
- LinkedIn-like professionalism
- Viral content potential

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### ✅ No Existing Functionality Affected

- All existing features work exactly as before
- New tables are completely separate
- Services are additive, not replacements
- Old SocialPage still works
- Database migrations are non-destructive

### ⚠️ Storage Bucket Setup

File uploads require a storage bucket:
- Create `post-files` bucket in Supabase
- Set appropriate permissions
- Configure size limits if needed

### 💡 Optional Usage

You don't have to use this feature immediately:
- Services exist but won't run unless called
- No UI changes until you implement them
- Database tables are ready but empty
- Can roll out gradually

## 📈 Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Attachments
1. Run the migrations
2. Test attaching notes/flashcards/quizzes
3. Build simple display UI
4. Launch to beta users

### Phase 2: File Uploads
1. Create storage bucket
2. Implement file picker UI
3. Add file type validation
4. Launch file attachments

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Add rich previews
2. Implement download tracking
3. Add sharing analytics
4. Build recommendation engine

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Attachment does not exist" error
→ Ensure the material belongs to the post author
→ Check that the material ID is correct
→ Verify user_id matches

### Attachments not showing
→ Run the migration file
→ Check RLS policies are created
→ Verify post visibility settings

### File uploads failing
→ Create the storage bucket
→ Check bucket permissions
→ Verify file size within limits

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Before launching:
- [ ] Run both migration files
- [ ] Test attaching a note
- [ ] Test attaching flashcards
- [ ] Test attaching a quiz
- [ ] Test file upload (if using)
