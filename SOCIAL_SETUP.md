## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

### Creating a Post
1. User creates post â†’ `social_posts` table
2. Post appears in feed
3. Followers see post in their following feed
4. Tags update trending topics

### Liking a Post
1. User clicks like â†’ `post_likes` table
2. Trigger increments `likes_count` in `social_posts`
3. Notification created for post author
4. Like status shown in feed

### Following a User
1. User clicks follow â†’ `user_followers` table
2. Follower count updated
3. Notification sent to followed user
4. Following feed updates

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Sample data is included in the migration for:
- Trending topics (Mathematics, Biology, etc.)

To test the features:

1. Create a user profile
2. Create some posts
3. Follow users
4. Join study groups
5. Check notifications

## ðŸ“± Mobile Considerations

The database is designed for:
- Offline-first with Supabase sync
- Efficient pagination
- Minimal data transfer
- Real-time subscriptions

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Run the migration SQL
2. Import the social service in your components
3. Update the SocialPage component to use real data
4. Add real-time subscriptions for live updates
5. Implement image upload for posts and profiles

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

1. **Pagination**: Always use limit/offset for feeds
2. **Real-time**: Subscribe to changes for notifications
3. **Caching**: Cache profile data to reduce queries
4. **Images**: Use Supabase Storage for image uploads
5. **Moderation**: Consider adding content moderation flags
6. **Privacy**: Respect user privacy settings

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Posts not appearing
- Check RLS policies
- Verify user authentication
- Check visibility settings

### Counts not updating
- Triggers should handle this automatically
- Verify triggers are enabled
- Check database logs

### Notifications not working
- Check RLS policies on notifications table
- Verify notification creation logic
- Test with simple query first
